# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
This analysis was performed using pgAdmin4 and PostgreSQL 11.

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to prepare for future transitions within the company as a large number of employees reach retirement age. This "silver tsunami" will leave many departments without leadership and key positions within the company. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the number of retiring employees in Pewlett-Hackard and also highlight the employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to replace those retiring.
